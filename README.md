## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Norapath Arjanurak, a Robotics and AI engineering graduate passionate about data, machine learning, and robotics integration. I enjoy solving complex problems by bridging the gap between AI models and real-world systems.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - Optimizing data lineage visualization tools and parsing engines for SQL structures.
  - Developing multi-lineage modeling features using Python and dbt.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - Advanced data engineering patterns, stream processing, and ML deployment best practices.
  - Deeper architectures in computer vision for robotics applications.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
  - Robotics control systems enhanced by AI/ML.
  - Interesting data engineering projects, especially involving BigQuery or AWS.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
  - Data pipelines, Kimball dimensional modeling, and BI dashboards.
  - Integrating hand tracking and vision systems with robotic arms.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
  - Email: norapath.arj@gmail.com
  - LinkedIn: [linkedin.com/in/norapath-arjanurak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/norapath-arjanurak)

- âš¡ Fun fact:
  - Served as master of ceremonies for events with over 200 participants, blending engineering leadership with public speaking.
